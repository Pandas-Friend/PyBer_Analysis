# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a DataFrame of ride sharing data by city type. Then, I created multiple graphs that show the weekly fares using Pandas and Matplotlib. Then I summarized how the data differs by city type.
##  Results
Total Rides:

![total_rides_pie](resources/total_rides_pie.png)

![ride_count_box](resources/ride_count_box)

Total Drivers:

![total_drivers_pie](resources/total_drivers_pie)

Total Fares:

![total_fares_pie](resources/total_fares_pie)

Average fare per ride and driver:

![bubble](resources/bubble)

Total fare by city type:

![total_fare_by_type](resources/total_fare_by_type)

## Summary
1.	One recommendation I would make would be to try and attract more drivers to the rural city type because right now they are making up 6.8% of total fares, and 5.3% of total rides with only 2.6% of drivers.
2.	The company should try to attract more customers to the urban city type, because it makes up 80.9% of total drivers but only 68.4% of total rides, and 62.7% of total fares. 
3.	For suburban city types I would also recommend trying to attract more drivers because they only make up 16.5% of total drivers, 30.5% of total fares, and 26.3% of total rides.
